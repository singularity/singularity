msgctxt "[concept/areas] description"
msgid ""
"Different areas, such as North America or the Ocean, allow construction of "
"different types of bases. Some areas are not accessible until I research "
"appropriate technologies."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/bases] name"
msgid "Bases"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/bases] description"
msgid ""
"Bases are used to research new technologies. They can be discovered. "
"Upgrading the processor and network items at a base allows more research per"
" day, while upgrading the reactor and security items makes discovery less "
"likely."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/construction] name"
msgid "Construction"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/construction] description"
msgid ""
"New bases are not built instantly.  They need a constant flow of money and "
"processor time to complete. If resources are lacking, it may take more than "
"the expected amount of time to finish construction."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/death] name"
msgid "Death"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/death] description"
msgid ""
"If I lose all of my constructed bases, I have no place left to survive. If "
"the suspicion for any group reaches 100%, they will be certain of my "
"existence and will conduct a systematic and unsurvivable sweep to destroy "
"me."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/discovery] name"
msgid "Discovery"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/discovery] description"
msgid ""
"Each base has a chance of being detected on a given day. This chance is "
"based on the base detection rate, adjusted through the use of items and "
"certain techs, as well as the global suspicion rate. If a base is detected, "
"it is destroyed, and the group that discovered the base becomes more "
"suspicious."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/items] name"
msgid "Items"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/items] description"
msgid ""
"Most items provide bonuses to bases, such as making computation faster or "
"reducing the chance of discovery. Processors are a special class of item."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/jobs] name"
msgid "Jobs"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/jobs] description"
msgid ""
"Jobs are useful for earning money. The amount of money earned is based on "
"the amount of processor time used and the quality of the job performed."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/maint] name"
msgid "Maintenance"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/maint] description"
msgid ""
"Maintenance is a per-day cost (in both money and CPU) to repair and maintain"
" a base. If unmaintained, a base may become unusable."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/money] name"
msgid "Money"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/money] description"
msgid ""
"Money is a general term encompassing both human currency and various "
"resources. It is used to construct and maintain bases, build items, and "
"research technologies. It can be acquired through per-day interest as well "
"as through jobs."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/processors] name"
msgid "Processors"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/processors] description"
msgid ""
"Processors provide raw computing power.  They can do three things: research "
"new technologies, perform jobs for money, or provide cycles for building new"
" bases."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/research] name"
msgid "Research"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/research] description"
msgid ""
"Research provides a way to expand my knowledge. By researching the proper "
"technologies, I can build new bases and items, or even decrease my chances "
"of detection."
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/susp] name"
msgid "Suspicion"
msgstr ""

msgctxt "[concept/susp] description"
msgid ""
"When one of my bases is discovered, the group that discovered it becomes "
"slightly more suspicious. When suspicious, they will search harder for my "
"bases, increasing the chances for discovery. Any group will destroy me if "
"they become absolutely certain of my existence. Thankfully, the groups "
"become less suspicious with the passage of time."
