Endgame: Singularity Changelog

V1.XX (YYYY.YY.YY):

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
- The game now requires `polib`. Previously, we had an embedded
  copy as fallback. However, it did not work with python3.11.
- New feature: Quicksaves - save on `F5` (replacing "reload theme")
  and load on `F9`. Loading can only occur on the map screen.
  Note the quicksave currently do not provide feedback on success.
- The hotkey `F5` is now "quicksave" rather than "reload theme".
  (Reload theme is now `F6`).
- Save games are now ordered by time (most recent first) rather
  than name. This makes it easier to find the latest savegame.
- There is now an "Auto-build items" button in the base overview.
  It will propose building all the highest value items in each
  empty base slot (provided there is anything buildable for
  that base).

V1.00 (2020.07.02):

GAME CONTENT CHANGES:
- Locations with higher risk are now highlighted provided the
  relevant techs have been researched.  (nthykier)
- Add a new power state `Offline`, which applies to all bases
  under construction until they can become `Active`.  Bases in
  the `Offline` state currently behave like they are in the
  `Sleep` state.  Based on an idea from Wuzzy2 (Closes: #239,
  #245) (Xenega)
- The thrift modification from locations now also applies to
  CPU maintenance.  (Xenega)

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
- Support better translations of strings involving numbers
  such as "X Days" or "Y Hours".  (Closes: #262)  (gunchleoc)
- Fix a visual glitch in the ResearchScreen if the AI had no
  available CPU because all bases are asleep.  (nthykier)
- It is now possible to convert old savegames to the new format
  via the `Upgrade` button on the `Load` menu.  This avoids the
  hassle of having to manually load and save each game.
  (nthykier)
- Implement lexicographic sorting of strings by using Python's
  `locale.strxfrm`.  This provides better sorting order for
  non-English languages on all platforms where `locale.strxfrm`
  works.  Notable exception being MacOS, where Python is
  reported to have issues still.  (Closes: #271)  (gunchleoc)
- Add support for mouse-wheel scrolling in pygame 2 with SDL 2,
  which re-enables scrolling in lists.  (nthykier)
- Rewrite handling of "holding down key" to repeat a key press.
  This avoids false "key-repetition" with accented characters.
  Note that pygame2 with SDLv2 is needed to be able to repeat
  accented characters by holding down the key.  (Closes: #281)
  (nthykier)
- Change layout of Knowledge screen.  Among other things, this
  makes more room for concept names.  (Closes: #270, #279)
  (Xenega)
- Location screen now disables buttons that have no effect.
  Previously, they would just do "nothing" but where still
  clickable.  (nthykier)
- Ensure that singularity can start when installed and loaded
  via pkg_resources.load_entry_point.  (Closes #272)  (nthykier)
- Improve savegame dialog to use a translated version of the
  difficulty as default savegame and reject some invalid
  path names with a simple error message rather than an
  exception.  Furthermore, the "OK" button is now disabled when
  the savegame name in invalid.  (Closes #267)  (gunchleoc)
- Disable Load and Delete buttons in the load savegame dialog
  when there are no savegames.  (nthykier)
- Avoid a crash when clicking Load or Delete in the load
  savegame dialog where no savegames are available.
  (Closes: #274)  (Xenega)
- Add number separators in statistics screen.  (Closes: #266)
  (gunchleoc)
- Give text fields a distinct background color to make it easier
  to see if something is a text field and make title visible
  in darktheme.  (Closes #260) (gunchleoc)
- Add Scottish Gaelic translation.
  (Closes: #256, #268, #263, #286, #287)  (gunchleoc)
- Text resizing and layout changes to better accommodate for
  translations that need more space than the English text.
  (Closes: #258, #259, #263, #264, #269) (gunchleoc)
- Minimum resolution has been reduced to 100x100.
  (rofl0r, nthykier)
- Enable the game window to be resized like any other window
  e.g. by dragging in the edges of the game window.  (nthykier)
- Reliably redraw the singularity screen if another window
  was moved over the game.  When singularity was run with
  pygame 2, this behaviour introduced visible artifacts until
  something in the game triggered a complete redraw.
  (nthykier)
- Fix a number of bugs related to the Power state of bases
  under construction - like being able to change the power
  state of an incomplete base.  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting
  the issue.  (Closes: #238, related to: #239, #245) (Xenega)
- Limit resolution input fields in the Options screen to digit
  characters only.  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting the issue.
  (related to: #236) (Xenega)
- Show the correct CPU maintenance cost for bases in the base
  screen.  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting the issue.
  (Closes: #243) (Xenega)
- Fix a crash with "ridiculously" small resolutions by setting
  a minimum resolution (during startup and in the options
  screen).  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting the issue.
  (Closes: #240) (Xenega)
- Add an `OK` button next to the custom resolution fields in
  the Options screen.  Previously, there was a confusingly named
  button labelled `Custom`, which people mistook for a label
  rather than a button.  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting the
  issue.  (Closes:  #236, #242) (Xenega)
- Fix focus handling in the Knowledge screen, making keyboard
  and mouse-wheel actions much more predictable.  Thanks to
  Wuzzy2 for reporting the issue.  (Closes: #220) (Xenega)
- Fix bug where choosing `Cancel` in the Options menu would not
  roll back changes to the selected theme.  (nthykier)
- Fix some minor color issues with the Nightmode theme, where
  the default color was used or text became unreadable.
  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting the issue.  (Closes #225, #227)
  (nthykier)
- Make room for longer tech names in the Knowledge screen to
  account for some tech names being significantly longer in
  translations.  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting the issue.
  (Closes #219) (nthykier, Xenega)
- Fix a regression where changing the language in game would
  fail to update the tech names and descriptions.
  (Closes: #232) (nthykier)
- Fix crash in the Load dialog when clicking Load if no game
  was selected.  (nthykier)
- When building bases or CPU for a base, show the correct CPU
  provided when the base/CPU is constructed.  Previously it would
  not take location and base modifiers into account. Thanks to
  Wuzzy2 for reporting the issue.  (Closes: #230) (nthykier)
- Fix bug where clicking Cancel in the Options menu would still
  commit changes to selected warnings.  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for
  reporting the issue.  (Closes: #230) (nthykier)
- Use correct number separator for money under non-English
  locales (e.g. comma in German) when measured in millions
  or more. Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting the issue.
  (Closes: #226) (nthykier)
- Ensure that the about menu text is extracted for translations
  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting its absence.  (Closes: #218)
  (nthykier)
- Fix a bug where part of the tech description in the Knowledge
  menu was not translatable.  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting it.
  (Closes: #217) (nthykier)
- Fix overly precise durations due to missing rounding when
  displaying construction times in Python3.  Thanks to
  Wuzzy2 for reporting it.  (Closes: #222)  (nthykier)
- Make scrollbar arrows visible in "Nightmode" theme.
  Thanks to Wuzzy2 for reporting it.  (Closes: #221)
  (nthykier)
- Add updated German translation.  (Closes: #215, #223, #288)

  (MestreLion)
- In debug mode (--debug), highlight which part of the screen
  has been redrawn by drawning a box around it.  (nthykier)
- Fix some internal bugs that lead to unnecessary redraws of
  some of the text panels in the map screen.  (nthykier)


Thanks to Wuzzy2, rofl0r, gunchleoc, and LW-archlinux, Quix0r for

v1.0b1 (2020.02.16):

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
- Show a summary of the bases under the CPU and money display.
  (Closes: #155, #196)  (nthykier)
- Fix a bug where Australia would never get a modifier if the game
  was created with python3.  (nthykier)
- Fix a crash when accessing the Log menu when playing a game loaded
  from a 1.0a1 (or later) game.

OTHER CHANGES:
- Documented known issues with running singularity on MacOS in the
  README.  Please see #197 for more details.  Thanks to yiwangwuqian
  for reporting and Diegus83 for debugging it and finding a
  possible solution.  (nthykier)
- All translations are now done via ".po" files (GNU Gettext) to
  ensure everything uses the same work flow for translators.
  (nthykier)
- Refactor handling of regional modifiers.  This caused a bump in
  the savegame format, which means games saved by 1.0b1 cannot
  be loaded in earlier versions of singularity.  (nthykier)


v1.0a2 (2019.12.28):

GAME CONTENT CHANGES:
- The location Antarctic is now considered as safe as the Ocean
  location and can therefore be used to research certain dangerous
  technologies. (Closes: #173) (Xenega, nthykier)
- Several key technologies can no longer be researched in Urban
  areas. (Closes: #173) (Xenega, nthykier)

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
- Fix hotkey clash between "PAUSE" and "PREV".  (Closes: #212)
  (danuker, nthykier)
- Improve keyboard + focus handling for most dialogs by passing
  keyboard events on to lists, sliders and text fields in the
  dialog.  This enables most dialogs to be handled entirely using
  keyboard only.  (Closes: #209, #211) (nthykier)
- Replace the GUI click sound to be softer.  (Closes: #201, #210)
  (danuker)
- Fix crash when loading an old savegame, where the player was
  researching something that is now not possible due to balancing
  changes. The game would be often be playable for a short while
  until something triggered a recalculation of CPU usage.  (nthykier)
- Fix incomplete substitution in log messages about bases being lost
  due to lack of maintenance.  (nthykier)
- Fix a crash when loading a 1.0alpha1 savegame and opening the log.
  (Closes: #208) (nthykier)
- Reduced the default size for text to ensure that most text fields
  have a consistent text size. (Closes: #200) (nthykier)
- Text fields now respond to the HOME + END keys and they move the
  cursor to the start and end of the text field.  (nthykier)
- Show the correct warning when attempting to load unsupported
  savegames.  Previously, it would silently be omitted.  (nthykier)
- Support loading old savegames with a particular corruption where
  the number of items in a base were sometimes set to the invalid
  value of 0.  The only sane fix is to reset the counter to 1 at
  the expense of some bases "losing" CPU. (Closes:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/singularity/+bug/931037,
  https://code.google.com/p/endgame-singularity/issues/detail?id=107)
  (nthykier)
- Using the arrow keys on the research slider no longer trips "two"
  clicks rather than one.  (Closes: #207,
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/singularity/+bug/531871)
  (nthykier)
- Buttons to construct base items are now disabled when the player
  cannot built any item of that particular item.
- Fixed a crash in the build dialog for a base if you tried to build
  a security item but had not researched any for that particular base.
  (Closes: #206) (nthykier)
- Added savegame compat for some older development savegames known as
  "0.31pre" by discarding the log entries from them. (Closes: #198,
  #199) (nthykier)
- Fixed a bug where trigger times of events where reset on loading
  the game leading them to last longer than they should.  (nthykier)

OTHER CHANGES:
- Include version information in the error log to simplify reporting
  of bugs and crashes.  (nthykier)

  The themes can have language specific content (e.g. fonts better
  suited for the given language) (MestreLion, Xenega)
- Support changing language without restarting the game
  (Xenega)
- Add warnings for some common issues such as when the player only
  has one base left or that when changing CPU of a base will remove

OTHER CHANGES:
- Refactored code into a top-level module called singularity instead of using
  generic top-level python modules nad improve setup.py to be setuptools
  compatible (Closes: #12)  (rardiol)
- New savegame format based on JSON to avoid a savegame format that can include
  arbitrary code execution via Python's pickle module.  Please note that any old
  style savegame will still trip the picke-based codepaths already in the
  savegame listing to simplify the process for players upgrading from 0.30c
  (Closes: #52)  (nthykier)
- Add basic documentation of the data files in the docs/ folder of the Github
