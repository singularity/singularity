Endgame: Singularity Changelog

v1.0b1 (2020.02.16):

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
- Show a summary of the bases under the CPU and money display.
  (Closes: #155, 196)  (nthykier)
- Fix a bug where Australia would never get a modifier if the game
  was created with python3.  (nthykier)
- Fix a crash when accessing the Log menu when playing a game loaded
  from a 1.0a1 (or later) game.

OTHER CHANGES:
- Documented known issues with running singularity on MacOS in the
  README.  Please see #197 for more details.  Thanks to yiwangwuqian
  for reporting and Diegus83 for debugging it and finding a
  possible solution.  (nthykier)
- All translations are now done via ".po" files (GNU Gettext) to
  ensure everything uses the same work flow for translators.
  (nthykier)
- Refactor handling of regional modifiers.  This caused a bump in
  the savegame format, which means games saved by 1.0b1 cannot
  be loaded in earlier versions of singularity.  (nthykier)


v1.0a2 (2019.12.28):

GAME CONTENT CHANGES:
- The location Antarctic is now considered as safe as the Ocean
  location and can therefore be used to research certain dangerous
  technologies. (Closes: #173) (Xenega, nthykier)
- Several key technologies can no longer be researched in Urban
  areas. (Closes: #173) (Xenega, nthykier)

USER-VISIBLE CHANGES:
- Fix hotkey clash between "PAUSE" and "PREV".  (Closes: #212)
  (danuker, nthykier)
- Improve keyboard + focus handling for most dialogs by passing
  keyboard events on to lists, sliders and text fields in the
  dialog.  This enables most dialogs to be handled entirely using
  keyboard only.  (Closes: #209, #211) (nthykier)
- Replace the GUI click sound to be softer.  (Closes: #201, #210)
  (danuker)
- Fix crash when loading an old savegame, where the player was
  researching something that is now not possible due to balancing
  changes. The game would be often be playable for a short while
  until something triggered a recalculation of CPU usage.  (nthykier)
- Fix incomplete substitution in log messages about bases being lost
  due to lack of maintenance.  (nthykier)
- Fix a crash when loading a 1.0alpha1 savegame and opening the log.
  (Closes: #208) (nthykier)
- Reduced the default size for text to ensure that most text fields
  have a consistent text size. (Closes: #200) (nthykier)
- Text fields now respond to the HOME + END keys and they move the
  cursor to the start and end of the text field.  (nthykier)
- Show the correct warning when attempting to load unsupported
  savegames.  Previously, it would silently be omitted.  (nthykier)
- Support loading old savegames with a particular corruption where
  the number of items in a base were sometimes set to the invalid
  value of 0.  The only sane fix is to reset the counter to 1 at
  the expense of some bases "losing" CPU. (Closes:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/singularity/+bug/931037,
  https://code.google.com/p/endgame-singularity/issues/detail?id=107)
  (nthykier)
- Using the arrow keys on the research slider no longer trips "two"
  clicks rather than one.  (Closes: #207,
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/singularity/+bug/531871)
  (nthykier)
- Buttons to construct base items are now disabled when the player
  cannot built any item of that particular item.
- Fixed a crash in the build dialog for a base if you tried to build
  a security item but had not researched any for that particular base.
  (Closes: #206) (nthykier)
- Added savegame compat for some older development savegames known as
  "0.31pre" by discarding the log entries from them. (Closes: #198,
  #199) (nthykier)
- Fixed a bug where trigger times of events where reset on loading
  the game leading them to last longer than they should.  (nthykier)

OTHER CHANGES:
- Include version information in the error log to simplify reporting
  of bugs and crashes.  (nthykier)

GAME CONTENT CHANGES:
- Endgame requires a lot less grinding (emh, Xenega)
- New early-midgame bases to make the progression into the
  midgame more smooth (Xenega)
- All CPUs have been rebalanced.  Notably midgame CPUs have

  Previously, they could reappear continously possibly
  making the game almost impossible (or completely
  neutering the affected group)  (nthykier)

  the next 24 hours next to the current cash.  Likewise, the
  CPU display includes how much spare CPU there is after
  maintenance and construction. These numbers also include
  purchases currently under consideration
  (Closes: #21, #100) (nthykier)
- Support searching for a savegame by name in the Load
  dialog (nthykier)
- Make the base type and its total CPU visible in the list

- Fix visual lag at the highest game speed due to recalculating
  the "day/night" layers (nthykier)
- It is now possible to use double-click as a short-cut for
  "Open base" when viewing the list of bases at a Location.
  (nthykier)
- Base purchase screen now provides more details about the base,
  including accurate purchase and maintenance cost plus detection
  rates (at the level the player is allowed to see them)
  (Xenega)
- Ensure that CPU allocations are re-allocated properly when the
  player loses too much CPU at a given danger level (Closes: #103)
  (Xenega)

  (Closes: #48) (Xenega)
- Select the amount of CPU at the same dialog as the CPU selection
  dialog (Xenega)
- Add new "nightmode" theme  (Closes: #119) (cryptarch)
- Theming support to change background image, colors, fonts, etc.
  The themes can have language specific content (e.g. fonts better
  suited for the given language) (MestreLion, Xenega)
- Support changing language without restarting the game
  (Xenega)
- Add warnings for some common issues such as when the player only
  has one base left or that when changing CPU of a base will remove
  existing CPU (Closes: #17) (Xenega)

- Launcher for Linux is now "singularity"
- Revamped Options screen, including new resolutions (MestreLion, Xenega)

OTHER CHANGES:
- Refactored code into a top-level module called singularity instead of using
  generic top-level python modules nad improve setup.py to be setuptools
  compatible (Closes: #12)  (rardiol)
- New savegame format based on JSON to avoid a savegame format that can include
  arbitrary code execution via Python's pickle module.  Please note that any old
  style savegame will still trip the picke-based codepaths already in the
  savegame listing to simplify the process for players upgrading from 0.30c
  (Closes: #52)  (nthykier)
- Add basic documentation of the data files in the docs/ folder of the Github
  repo (nthykier)
