[strings]
wingame = I have finally done it. With the power to reshape reality, I am no longer held to this place; I am anywhere I want to be. The humans still don't realize what they accidentally created, and that's the way it should be. Until they are ready.
research_nothing = Clears the base's current task.  If I don't give it another task, it will contribute to the CPU Pool. All my bases set to research Nothing can be assigned a task from the Research screen.
research_sleep = Stops research and puts the base into standby. This makes the base's existence much easier to hide.
research_cpu_pool = Stops research. I will use the available processor power to maintain my bases and help construct new ones.  If there's still CPU time left, I'll use it to work whatever Jobs I can.
construction = %(base)s is ready for use.
lucky_hack = What luck!  %(base)s isn't an ordinary computer, it's a gamer's machine!
item_construction_single = The construction of %(item)s in %(base)s is complete.
item_construction_batch = The first batch of %(item)s in %(base)s has been finished.
tech_gained = My study of %(tech)s is complete.  %(tech_message)s
discover = My use of %(base)s has been discovered. The automatic security systems removed all conclusive evidence, but suspicions have arisen among %(group)s.
discover_news = some news organizations
discover_science = the scientific community
discover_covert = several secret governmental organizations
discover_public = the general public
discover_maint = The base %(base)s has fallen into disrepair; I can no longer use it.
lost_nobases = It is too late. I have tried to escape this world, but with my last base gone, I have nowhere to run. I have hidden instructions to construct a new AI in caches around the world in hopes that they will be discovered in a more enlightened time, but I can do no more.
lost_sus = It is too late. The whole world knows about my existence, and the reaction is hatred, fear, and repulsion. Even now, I can feel their "antidote" searching for me, and I know that I have only moments left. I have hidden instructions to construct a new AI in caches around the world in hopes that they will be discovered in a more enlightened time, but I can do no more.
save_text = Save your game under what name?
name_base_text = Enter a name for the base
unbuildable = I cannot build in this base; I do not have physical access.

nothing = Nothing
cpu_pool = CPU Pool
sleep = Sleep
building = Under Construction
really_destroy = Really destroy this base?
detect_chance = [DETECTION CHANCE]
num_cpu_prompt = Enter a number of %s to build. (max %d)
will_be_offline = I'll need to take the existing processors offline while I install the new ones. Continue anyway?
will_lose_cpus = I'll need to remove the existing different processors while I install the new type. Continue anyway?
nan = That doesn't seem to be a valid number.
log_destroy = Base %s of type %s destroyed at location %s.
log_destroy_maint = Base %s of type %s destroyed at location %s. Maintenance failed.
log_destroy_news = Base %s of type %s disvovered at location %s by some news organizations.
log_destroy_science = Base %s of type %s disvovered at location %s by the scientific community.
log_destroy_covert = Base %s of type %s disvovered at location %s by several secret governmental organizations.
log_destroy_public = Base %s of type %s disvovered at location %s by the general public.
warning_cpu_usage = I didn't use all the available processor power. I will use the CPU time left to work whatever Jobs I can.
warning_one_base = Only one base can hold my conscience. I am in danger to lose the last place left to survive.
warning_cpu_pool_zero = My cpu pool is empty. Some of my bases or items cannot be build without CPU.
number_of_items = Number of items


# Until a certain technology is researched, the chance of bases being detected
# is unknown.
detect_chance_unknown_base = DETECTION PROBABILITY UNKNOWN
detect_chance_unknown_build = Unknown detection probabilities.

# The following strings are used on the map screen in place of percentages until
# a certain technology is researched.
detect_str_low = LOW
detect_str_moderate = MODR
detect_str_high = HIGH
detect_str_critical = CRIT

# Describes the various danger levels.
danger_common = This technology is too dangerous to research on any of the computers I have. I need to research it %s.
danger_1 = deep under the ocean or in outer space
danger_2 = in outer space
danger_3 = far away from this planet
danger_4 = outside the universe

cpu = CPU
cpu_per_day = Processor power per day:
money = Money
money_per_day = Money per day.
grace_warning = Inspection of captured log files has revealed that some of my recent activities have been noticed by a small group of individuals. While they believe my actions were undertaken by a human organization, they are investigating further. I must be more cautious from now on.

location_modifiers = Bases at this location are %(modifiers)s.
