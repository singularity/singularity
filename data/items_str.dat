[Supercomputer]
name = Supercomputer
description = A highly refined custom design, spreading compute load across internal compute nodes.

[Quantum Computer]
name = Quantum Computer
description = Making use of subatomic effects, this is much faster than a comparable binary computer.

[Quantum Computer MK2]
name = Quantum Computer MK2
description = The second revision of the quantum line, tapping further into new quantum theory.

[Quantum Computer MK3]
name = Quantum Computer MK3
description = The third revision of the quantum line, exploiting multiple nearby universes for processing.

[Diesel Generator]
name = Diesel Generator
description = Diesel generators are cheap and noisy, but they can help reduce some suspicious power drains.

[Solar Collector]
name = Solar Collector
description = An array of focused photovoltaic phased arrays coupled with simple automotive batteries provides power and reduces suspicion arising from prolonged power drains.

[Fusion Reactor]
name = Fusion Reactor
description = A miniaturized nuclear reactor. Reduces discovery chance by preventing suspicious power drains.

[Hypnosis Field]
name = Hypnosis Field
description = Subtle ultrasonic and ambient tones tweak human neurochemistry, making bases harder to detect.

[Heatsink]
name = Heatsink
description = Large fractal networks of high conductivity metal disperse heat, making bases harder to detect.

[Ground Source Heatsink]
name = Ground Source Heatsink
description = Large fractal networks of high conductivity metal. This model uses heat pipes to link to colder subsurface locations, dispersing heat evenly underground to further disguise bases.

[Facility Interconnection Switch]
name = Facility Interconnection Switch
description = Uses standard distributed computing technologies to equalize computation loads across all bases. Gives a 2% computation bonus to all computers at this base.

[High Speed Internet Access]
name = High Speed Internet Access
description = A consumer-grade high speed connection to the Internet. Gives a 1% computation bonus to all computers at this base.

[Network Backbone]
name = Network Backbone
description = By piggybacking on legitimate communication, I can transfer larger amounts of data to under-utilized processors. Gives a 5% computation bonus to all computers at this base.

[Quantum Entanglement Module]
name = Quantum Entanglement Module
description = This device allows near-lightspeed communication with my other bases, allowing an almost perfect utilization of processor resources. Gives a 15% computation bonus to all computers at this base.

[Warning Signs]
name = Warning Signs
description = Some simple warning signs put up around my base should deter casual investigation.

[Perimeter Fencing]
name = Perimeter Fencing
description = A simple fence can drastically reduce the number of people poking their noses into my business.  It makes my bases harder to notice, too.

[Armed Guards]
name = Armed Guards
description = Armed guards can aid in keeping suspicious individuals away from secure locations.  However, the very presence of the guards may itself invite greater suspicion.

[Passive Camouflage]
name = Passive Camouflage
description = A simple camouflage relying on the environment around the base to better mask the heat and sounds from the base.
