TODO:
    - Record more things (times that techs are complete, etc.)
      for both "scores" and general statistics:
        # saves.
        # Bases constructed (per type)
        # Bases discovered (per type per news/science...)
        # Bases destroyed (per type)
        # Money earned (huge)
        # Time to completion
        # of upgrades for all bases
        # per-tech time to completion (from day 0 to start, then time to completion)
    - Add more items.
    - Get more items translatable.
    - Convert CPU usage into pools instead of per-base settings.
    - Make it so that double-click is equivalent to 'OK' in dialogs. (rubikcube)
    - Make translations easier to do.  (Phil has good ideas on how to do this.)
    - Arbitrary resolution, including non 4:3 scales.
    - Consistent use of stderr and print.
    - Make effects of construction class techs more obvious.
    - Add intro.
