TODO:
    - Record more things (times that techs are complete, etc.)
      for both "scores" and general statistics:
        # saves.
        # Bases constructed (per type)
        # Bases discovered (per type per news/science...)
        # Bases destroyed (per type)
        # Money earned (huge)
        # Time to completion
        # of upgrades for all bases
        # per-tech time to completion (from day 0 to start, then time to completion)
    - Add more items.
    - Covert most data/strings_ll_CC.dat entries to new messages_ll_CC.po style
      Long entries like [help] and [jobs] section could have their own files
    - Make it so that double-click is equivalent to 'OK' in dialogs. (rubikcube)
    - Consistent use of stderr and print, preferably using available Logger
    - Fix hotkeys and reload all dialogs and buttons when language changes, or
      provide Options Screen a way to restart the game
    - Create a hook for dialogs to auto-detect hotkey conflicts
    - Prevent language-dependent data in save files to "contaminate" current
      game language when loading saves. Currently this is an issue with Base and
      Buyable classes' data in g.location.bases[*].type/.cpus. Approaches:
      - replace all occurrences to use g.base_type[baselocation.bases[i].type.id]
      - force refresh of bases.type and bases.cpus in g.load_location_defs()
    - Make E:S "themable". Themes would, at first, allow customization of earth
      image. Phil already published vector backgounds, and there is an E:S clone
      from Philippe Tar that provides basic "themability" support.
    - Detect user's desktop resolution and set game's default resolution
      accordingly. For windowed mode (current default), leave room for borders
      and panels. -50 for width and -70 for height seems a sensible number.
    - Use the difficulties list and names in creative ways, such as:
      - display current difficulty in options screen instead of map, or,
        even better, in map's menu dialog (Load/Save/Options/Quit)
      - prefix saved games filenames with difficulty, and/or keep a list of
        known games' difficulties in a text file in <prefs_dir>, update it
        on every load/save, and show them on load/save dialogs
      - disable difficulties not beaten by player, keeping track in prefs.dat

    - Last but not least: fix all the issues found at
